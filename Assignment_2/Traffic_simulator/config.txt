Signal RED			# Make the signal RED

# Send vehicles with given types on the road (one per second)
Car GREEN
bike BLUE
bike GREEN
Bus BLUE
Auto BLUE

Pass 15				# Let the simulation keep running for 15 seconds

# Now below vehicles enter the road
Car GREEN
bike BLUE
Truck GREEN
Bus BLUE

# Turn the signal green
Signal GREEN

END			# If signal is GREEN, end should wait till road is clear
